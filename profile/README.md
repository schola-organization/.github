## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This organization is dedicated exclusively to storing all projects developed as part of my Professional Aptitude Project (PAP). The PAP aims to integrate and apply the knowledge acquired throughout my training. Each project represents an important milestone in my learning process and in the development of practical skills aimed at my professional career.

All the projects presented here were created with the aim of demonstrating my technical capacity, creativity and problem solving, using tools, methodologies and good practices widely recognized in the market.

If you are interested in a specific project or want to know more about the development approach, don't hesitate to get in touch.
